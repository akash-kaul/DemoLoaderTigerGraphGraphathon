# DemoLoaderTigerGraphGraphathon
Submission for TigerGraph Graphathon contest by Akash Kaul

## Brief Description:
I created a google Colab notebook that uses interactive widgets to allow a user to automatically upload demos from the TigerGraph Github to their own servers for easy use

## Example Usage
To use this demo loader:
1. Open the provided notebook in Google Colab
2. Run the notebook
3. Enter the server information for your TigerGraph box and click the button
4. In the resulting page, choose the demo you would like to upload
5. Hit upload (this erases your current graph and installs a new one)
6. Explore your graph
